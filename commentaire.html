To add an image as a background to the website page
We take the identification code for body, which is body2, and at its beginning we add a hashtag and open two incubators.
Then we add the background-image: feature and choose the image we need.


-To edit the comments area on the site page We take the special identifier in the div because the textrea element for 
the comment location is inside it.
 And the symbol is NOS and at the beginning we add a hashtag and open two incubators.
Then we modify the size by adding the height feature
We adjust the space between the comment frame and the page border by adding a margin and setting its area through the margin feature

Let's add a comment area. I added the textra element.
And I added some elements to adjust the size like height
And inserting a text showing the comment area disappears when writing by adding the placeholder feature and writing the text in it.
We also add cols to specify the maximum number of comment characters used.
Also, to determine who we will send the comment to, we add the feature name and specify the addressee. 
In our example this we call it comment because we do not have the server.-->
